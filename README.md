# Operating-platforms-CS230

The Gaming Room, our client, wanted to expand their game Draw It or Lose It from an Android-only application to a web-based platform that supports multiple operating systems. Their main requirements included scalability, multi-user support, and a secure distributed system. While developing the software design document, I focused on clearly defining the system architecture and incorporating best practices for memory and storage management to ensure smooth performance. One aspect of the design process I found helpful was breaking the project into smaller sections, such as user management, game logic, and data storage, which made the development more manageable. If I could improve one area, I would refine the network communication strategy to further enhance real-time multiplayer interactions. Understanding the userâ€™s needs was crucial, as the game had to be fast, reliable, and easy to use across different devices. This meant designing an efficient client-server model that minimized lag while handling multiple players at once. In future projects, I would continue to use modular software design, cloud-based storage solutions, and user feedback loops to improve both functionality and user experience.
